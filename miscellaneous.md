#Constructors

Constructors are generally used for object instantiating.
When we create the object of any class then by default its constructor gets called.
# In python the constructor is declared as:-
>def __init__(self):
    pass

### There are two types of constructors exists
#### Default constructor
>This type of constructor does not have any value.

#### Parameterized constructor
>Constructor with parameter is know as parameterized constructor.

# Destructors
Deleting the object reference and making the memory free is called as desctructors.
In python it is automatically handled.
Sometime you have to do it, It's not that much needed as constructors.
